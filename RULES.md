# 📋 RULES.md — AI Agent Rules & Project Guidelines

> **EVERY AI assistant (Copilot, Cursor, Gemini, Claude, GPT, etc.) MUST read this file before
> making any change to this repository.**
> This file is the single source of truth for how this project is structured,
> how code should be written, and what patterns must be followed at all times.

## 📖 Repository Documentation Index

All structural, architectural, database, and coding guidelines have been separated into modular, detailed files inside the [docs/](./docs/) folder.

### 🏛️ System Architecture

- **[Project Structure & Boundaries](./docs/architecture/project_structure.md)** — Visual hierarchy of frontend/backend components, and rules of where files belong.
- **[API Reference](./docs/architecture/api_reference.md)** — Complete route endpoints table for the Express backend and Python services.
- **[Local Database](./docs/architecture/database.md)** — Table schemas for `projects`, `panels`, and query caching logic with SQLite.
- **[Environment Variables](./docs/architecture/environment_variables.md)** — Port mappings, API credentials setup, and limits checking configurations.
- **[npm Scripts](./docs/architecture/npm_scripts.md)** — Compiling, building, hot-reloading dev, and docker commands.

### 💻 Development & Engineering Standards

- **[Coding Guidelines](./docs/development/coding_guidelines.md)** — Rules for Express route processing, custom React hooks lifecycle, and FastAPI wrapper setups.
- **[Standard Code Templates](./docs/development/code_templates.md)** — Standard layouts and section definitions for components, hooks, Express routes, and Python modules.
- **[Key Coding Patterns](./docs/development/key_patterns.md)** — Standard code implementations for Gemini retries, Sharp cropping, shell exec calls, and colors logging.

## 🔄 Auto-Update Rule — MANDATORY FOR ALL AI AGENTS

> **Every AI assistant MUST update this file at the end of every conversation.**
> This keeps `RULES.md` as a living document that is always 100% accurate.

### When to Update RULES.md

You MUST update this file if you did ANY of the following during the conversation:

### How to Update the Changelog

At the **end of every conversation**, append one row to the Session Changelog table below:

```
| YYYY-MM-DD | Brief summary of what changed | Files affected |
```

- Use `—` (em dash) if a column doesn't apply.
- Keep summaries short (under 15 words).
- List all affected files separated by commas.
- **Do not skip this step, even for small changes.**

## 🚫 Things AI Must NEVER Do

1. **Never delete** `package-lock.json` — it ensures reproducible builds.
2. **Never commit** `.env`, `.env.local`, or any file containing real API keys.
3. **Never call** `ai.models.generateContent()` without wrapping it in `callGeminiWithRetry()`.
4. **Never use** `python` (without the `3`) in shell commands — use `python3`.
5. **Never add** new npm packages without updating this file's tech stack table.
6. **Never place** React components outside of `frontend/src/components/`.
7. **Never place** Python service files outside of `backend/python/services/`.
8. **Never expose** stack traces or raw error objects in API JSON responses.
9. **Never hardcode** localhost, IP addresses, or port numbers in frontend code.
10. **Never use** `any` TypeScript type without a comment explaining why.
11. **Never put** all routes in one giant file — split by domain into `ai/`, `image/`, `scraper/` sub-folders.
12. **Never put** hook logic directly in `App.tsx` — extract into `frontend/src/hooks/`.
13. **Never put** Python scripts directly in `backend/services/` — use `backend/python/services/`.

## ✅ Before Submitting Any Change

- [ ] Does the new code follow the file placement rules?
- [ ] Are all TypeScript types properly defined in `src/types.ts`?
- [ ] Do all Gemini API calls use `callGeminiWithRetry()`?
- [ ] Do all Python service calls handle `ImportError` gracefully?
- [ ] Is the `.env.example` updated if new environment variables were added?
- [ ] Is this `RULES.md` updated if new files, folders, or API endpoints were added?
- [ ] Are all API routes documented in the API table?
- [ ] Are all new console log calls using ANSI color helpers from `colors.ts`?
- [ ] Are new components split into modular sub-components if over ~300 lines?

> [!IMPORTANT] > **AI Agent Reminder:** Before ending this conversation, scroll up to the 📅 Session Changelog
> and add a row describing what you changed. Then update any stale sections above.
> This is not optional — it is a required step of every session.

_All AI agents must treat this file as the highest-priority context for this repository._
_Automatically maintained — do not edit the changelog manually outside of AI sessions._
